# Eastall - Easy one line installer

One-line installation is very convenient for setting things up fast for development environment. Regardless, I **do not** recommend using one-line installation for production related stuffs.

Commonly supported distros:
- Centos
- Fedora
- RHEL
- Ubuntu
- Debian
